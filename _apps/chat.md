The OpenIntents Chat is a web client for the decentralized communication and collaboration network matrix.org. The app enables Blockstack and EOS users to connect to 7m+ users.

The app is a fork of [riot-web](https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web) adapted for authentication with decentralized identities. It connects to the matrix node openintents.modular.im.
